# **Objective**
Demonstrate my knowledge of front end development and design by creating a visually appealing, clean and attention grabbing online portfolio, using fundamental design/development concepts and best practices. The portfolio will highlight my skills, goals, experience and personality to prospective employers, new clients and/or collaboration opportunities.

# **Target Audience**
Employers, start-ups, SME's, developers, entrepreneurs.

## Target Audience Characteristics
* Employers: Want sound developers that have a solid foundation of fundamentals that can be built upon.
    * Build portfolio on minimal framework implementation, code is written myself. 
* Start-ups, employers & SME's: Fast-paced work environment with tight deadlines.
    * Outline my work ethic.
* SME's: Highly protective of their idea/business.
    * Encapsulate professionalism, emphasise on experience and show previous work.
* SME's: Tend to have minimal funds.
    * Look profressional, yet affordable and approachable, not too 'corporate'.

# **Design**

## Fun Modern Websites
Flat color schemes or complimentary color schemes.

## My Color Scheme 
Monochromatic. Dark and natural theme.

## My Color Pallete
Grey base and 1 bright, flat, accent color.

## Font Family
### Section & Page Headers
``font-family: "eurostile",sans-serif;`` <br>
A heavily weighted geometric sans-serif style font creating a design that is modern, clean and fun, yet professional. 
### Other Page Content
``font-family: "europa",sans-serif;`` <br>
A lightweight geometric and humanist sans-serif style font. Clean and modern. Offsets the heading font so that the headings become eye-catching yet not overly-distracting. Allows the site to flow very smoothly, with the site being a clean design visitors focus on designated areas and are not distracted or strained whilst on the site.

## Layout
## Personal Logo
## Usability & User Experience
### Simplicity
### Visual Hierachy
### Navigation
### Accesseibility
### Conventionality
## Sections
Sections are ordered to what is more valuable to the target audience. Each section is aimed to entice the audience into finding out more and, therefore, scrolling further into the other sections.
## Skills
Goal: Highlight my current skills and outline that my skills are expanding. Use visual aid so that the user can encapsulate what I can do quickly rather than reading large amounts of text.
## Work
Goal: Show my previous experience, explore what I have been able to do. Illustrate my drive, work ethic and that my skills are expanding.
## About Me
Goal: Highlight my experience in business, depth and quality of my work and how fast I progress at what I do. Touch on my passions to reveal a bit of my personality.
## Contact Me
Goal: Friendly and approachable. Encourage audience to reach out to me.
