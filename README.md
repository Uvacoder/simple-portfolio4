# **Design**

## Fun Modern Websites
Flat color schemes or complimentary color schemes.

## My Color Scheme 
Monochromatic. Dark and natural theme.

## My Color Pallete
Grey base and 1 bright, flat, accent color.

## Font Family
### Section & Page Headers
``font-family: "eurostile",sans-serif;`` <br>
A heavily weighted geometric sans-serif style font creating a design that is modern, clean and fun, yet professional. 
### Other Page Content
``font-family: "europa",sans-serif;`` <br>
A lightweight geometric and humanist sans-serif style font. Clean and modern. Offsets the heading font so that the headings become eye-catching yet not overly-distracting. Allows the site to flow very smoothly, with the site being a clean design visitors focus on designated areas and are not distracted or strained whilst on the site.

## Layout
